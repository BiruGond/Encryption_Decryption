# Encryption and Decryption System Using Time-Based Key Generation

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a secure encryption and decryption system that utilizes time as a dynamic factor to generate unique keys for encoding and decoding messages. The innovative approach enhances security by ensuring each encryption process is highly secure and resistant to key reuse and brute-force attacks.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Cryptographic Libraries**:
  - [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/): A robust, full-featured open-source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols as well as a full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.
  - [Libsodium](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/): A modern, easy-to-use cryptographic library that supports a wide range of cryptographic operations, including encryption, decryption, digital signatures, and more.

## Key Features
- **Time-Based Key Generation**: 
  - Developed an algorithm that generates encryption keys based on the current time, ensuring keys are unique and time-sensitive.
- **Enhanced Security**: 
  - Implemented additional security measures to protect against key reuse and brute-force attacks, making the system robust against common cryptographic vulnerabilities.
- **Real-Time Encryption/Decryption**: 
  - Enabled real-time message encryption and decryption with minimal computational overhead, optimizing both performance and security.

## Outcomes
- Successfully demonstrated the project with a 99% success rate in secure communication.
- Received positive feedback for its innovation and potential application in secure communications.
